And many more

[**metasm**](https://github.com/jjyg/metasm), an assembly manipulation suite

> My all time favourite piece of work that hardly anybody knows about. Metasm compiles / decompiles 
> about a dozen cpus and a handful of binary formats. In 100% ruby.
>
> -- [Torsten RÃ¼ger](https://github.com/dancinglightning)

[**moneta**](https://github.com/minad/moneta), a unified interface to key/value stores 

> Moneta provides a standard interface for interacting with various
> kinds of key/value stores. Moneta supports the well-known NoSQL and document based stores.
> It's kinda like Tilt, but for key-value stores.
